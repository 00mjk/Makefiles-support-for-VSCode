# Makefiles support for VSCode

Install this extension to have syntax support for [GNU Makefiles](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Installation

For now, installation can be done manually:

```bash
cd ~/.vscode/extensions  # or elsewhere, see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/yocode#_your-extensions-folder
git clone https://github.com/Naereen/Makefiles-support-for-VSCode/
mv Makefiles-support-for-VSCode makefiles-support-for-vscode-0.0.1
# restart Visual Studio Code to enable the extension
```

I will publish the extension as soon as possible on [VSCode Market](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery).

## Features

- Syntax support for Makefile.
- Comment or uncomment one or more line with the default comment shortcut.

## Release Notes

### [0.0.1](https://github.com/Naereen/Makefiles-support-for-VSCode/releases/tag/v0.0.1)
- First version, directly imported from TextMate language file from [a SublimeText3 extension (Makefile-plus)](https://github.com/Altomare/sublime-makefile-plus). I used [`yo code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/yocode).

----

## [TODO task](https://github.com/Naereen/Makefiles-support-for-VSCode/labels/enhancement)
- [ ] Embed [checkmake](https://github.com/mrtazz/checkmake) as a linting tool.
- [ ] Write a magical generic `.vscode/launch.json` file that adds any Makefile rule as a possible launch task (like [this extension for ST3](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MakeCommands)).
