## [0.0.1](https://github.com/Naereen/Makefiles-support-for-VSCode/releases/tag/v0.0.1)
- First version, directly imported from TextMate language file from [a SublimeText3 extension (Makefile-plus)](https://github.com/Altomare/sublime-makefile-plus). I used [`yo code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/yocode).
